I'm a software engineer. Some of my interests include:
- Formal languages
- Functional programming
- Web development

I am proficient in Python and TypeScript, and I'm currently mastering Rust and Elm.

## Writing

- [typing-tips](https://decorator-factory.github.io/typing-tips/), a collection of articles about Python's gradual typing system
- [py-humbleparser](https://github.com/decorator-factory/py-humbleparser) &mdash; my hot take on parsing unstructured data

## Linters

- [flake8-useless-assert](https://github.com/decorator-factory/flake8-useless-assert), a `flake8` plugin to detect bad `assert` statements
- [flake8-pep585](https://github.com/decorator-factory/flake8-pep585), a `flake8` plugin to find deprecated imports from `typing` (PEP 585)
- [mypy-plugin-attempt](https://github.com/decorator-factory/mypy-plugin-attempt) &mdash; I made a plugin for `mypy` and I'm still alive

- [pyright-playground](https://github.com/decorator-factory/pyright-playground) lets you play with [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), a Python type checker, in your browser.

## Experimental stuff and explorations

I wouldn't say I stand behind completeness or code quality in these projects. Consider these prototypes or proofs of concept :)

- [lanim](https://github.com/decorator-factory/lanim) is a library for making animations in Python, built on functional programming principles.
- [elm-markup-language-demo](https://github.com/decorator-factory/elm-markup-language-demo) &mdash; I'm making a Lisp-like markup language while I'm learning Elm
- [py-ast-rule-engine](https://github.com/decorator-factory/py-ast-rule-engine) &mdash; search for patterns in Python code using a giant YAML file
- [ts-generic-rep](https://github.com/decorator-factory/ts-generic-rep) &mdash; type-level lambdas, `map`, `filter` and `reduce` for TypeScript
- [py-bot-command-parser](https://github.com/decorator-factory/py-bot-command-parser) &mdash; combinator parser for chat bot commands
- [rs-interpreter-experiments](https://github.com/decorator-factory/rs-interpreter-experiments) &mdash; using different strategies to evaluate the same expression in Rust

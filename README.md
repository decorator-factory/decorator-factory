I'm a software engineer. Some of my interests include:
- Formal languages
- Functional programming
- Web development

I'm pretty good with Python and TypeScript. I'm superficially familiar with: C, Rust, Java, Kotlin, F#, Haskell, Agda, and I probably forgot some.

Some time ago I started tinkering with **Elm**, which single-handedly made me want to do frontend development again. I'm still figuring
out how to do UI design, though.

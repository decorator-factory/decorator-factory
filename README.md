I'm interested in web programming, formal languages and functional programming. 
I'm most familiar with Python and TypeScript, and I'm currently learning F# and Rust.

## My projects

- [typing-tips](https://decorator-factory.github.io/typing-tips/), a collection of articles about Python's gradual typing system
- [lanim](https://github.com/decorator-factory/lanim) is a library for making animations in Python, built on functional programming principles.
- [pyright-playground](https://github.com/decorator-factory/pyright-playground) lets you play with [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), a Python type checker, in your browser.
- [flake8-useless-assert](https://github.com/decorator-factory/flake8-useless-assert), a `flake8` plugin to detect bad `assert` statements
- [flake8-pep585](https://github.com/decorator-factory/flake8-pep585), a `flake8` plugin to find deprecated imports from `typing` (PEP 585)
